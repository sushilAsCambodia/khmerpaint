                                imperfections in the surface of walls, which can make them look more uniform and
                                professional.<br />
                                <b>:- </b>Improves the adhesion of other types of paint: Skim coat paint can help to
                                improve the
                                adhesion of other types of paint, such as latex paint or oil-based paint. This can help
                                to create a more durable finish that is less likely to chip or peel.
